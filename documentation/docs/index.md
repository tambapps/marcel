# Marcel, a concise and efficient JVM language for fast and elegant scripting


Marcel is a lightweight programming language designed to make scripting on the JVM simple, expressive, and fast — without sacrificing power or portability.

### Why Marcel?
- Concise & expressive: Say goodbye to boilerplate — Marcel lets you write clear, elegant code in less time.
- Android-ready: Marcel is guaranteed to compile and run on any Android device (Android 11+), making it ideal for mobile scripting or development on the go.
- Modern yet familiar: Inspired by Groovy, Kotlin, Perl, and Dart, Marcel brings together the best of several languages while staying lightweight and accessible.
- Hassle-free dependencies: Marcel includes [Dumbbell](./tools/dumbbell.md), a built-in dependency manager that makes it easy to import libraries in your scripts — no Maven or Gradle setup required.

### How it works
Marcel compiles directly to Java bytecode (.class files), making it fully compatible with any Java 17+ JVM. Just include the Marcel standard library in your classpath, and you’re good to go.

### Try it on Android
Want to code on your phone? Install [Marcel for Android](./tools/marcel-for-android.md) to write, compile, and run Marcel programs directly from your device.

### Open Source
Marcel is fully open-source — explore the language, or just dive into its internals on [GitHub](https://github.com/tambapps/marcel).
