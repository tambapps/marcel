# Marcel Documentation project

This project uses [mkdocs.org](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) (even though the binary name is still `mkdocs`.

## Commands

To serve
```shell
mkdocs serve
```

To deploy to gh-pages
```shell
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

To build (not useful for me)
```shell
mkdocs build
```
