# Comments

You can comment your code in Marcel the same way you would in Java.

Define comments like you would in Java. `// ...` for a single line comment, and `/* ... */` for a multi-line comment


```marcel
// this function does stuff
doStuff()

/* this function
  does some
  other stuff
 */
doOtherStuff()
```
