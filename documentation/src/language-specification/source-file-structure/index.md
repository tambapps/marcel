# Program structure

## Package
A Marcel source file can have a package. It is optional but if it is specified, it must be the first instruction in the file
(excluding comments)

```java
package my.package
```

## Imports
Then, some [imports](./imports.md) can follow. You can consult the default imported class/package [here](./imports.md#default-imports)

## Class

You can define [classes](./classes.md) like in Java. 


## Functions

Classes can have [functions](./functions.md)


## Fields

Classes can also have [fields](./classes.md#class-fields)
