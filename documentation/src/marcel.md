# Marcel, a simple and efficient programming language for any JVM

Marcel is a programming language built with the following goals in mind:
- Being simple, not too verbose, allowing to write programs quickly
- Runnable on Android devices (this language is **guaranteed** to be compilable and executable on any Android devices)

Its features are inspired from many languages such as Groovy, Kotlin, Perl and Dart. You can consult the source code of
this language [on GitHub](https://github.com/tambapps/marcel)

<br/>
Marcel compiles to Java bytecode (.class files). You can execute marcel script/projects on any JVMs, as long as the Marcel stdlib is included
in your classpath.

As stated above, marcel is guaranteed to be compilable and executable on any Android devices. You can install the [Marcel for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tambapps.marcel.android.marshell)
app to develop, compile and execute Marcel programs.

<br/>

Note that this language is at an early development stage (it started on January 2023) and is therefore not stable yet. I will do my
best not to bring radical changes, but I cannot guaranty that yet.
