# Marcel, a simple and efficient programming language for any JVM

Marcel is a programming language built with the following goals in mind:
- Being simple, not too verbose, allowing to write programs quickly
- Runnable on Android devices (this language is **guaranteed** to be compilable and executable on Android devices)

Its features are inspired from many languages such as Groovy, Kotlin, Perl and Dart. You can consult the source code of
this language [on GitHub](https://github.com/tambapps/marcel)

<br/>

Marcel compiles to Java bytecode (.class files). You can execute marcel script/projects on any JVMs (17+), as long as the Marcel stdlib is included
in your classpath.

As stated above, marcel is guaranteed to be compilable and executable on any Android devices running on Android 11 or +. You can install the [Marcel for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tambapps.marcel.android.marshell)
app to develop, compile and execute Marcel programs.
