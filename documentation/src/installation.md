# Installation

To be able to compile and execute marcel scripts, you'll need the
`marcl`, MARcel Command Line tool.


For now there is no proper way to install it. You'll have to clone my [repo](https://github.com/tambapps/marcel) and 
package the project using maven. Then, you can execute the `marcl` jar built on `marcl/target/`.
