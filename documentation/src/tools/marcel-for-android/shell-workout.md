# Shell Workouts

Shell Workouts are scripts that you can execute in the background. They can perform heavy
I/O operations while you do other things on your phone.

They were implemented using [Android's WorkoutManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager).

Thanks to these APIs, you can **schedule** Shell Workouts to run at a specific time, and/or make them **periodic**
so that they are run every x hours.
