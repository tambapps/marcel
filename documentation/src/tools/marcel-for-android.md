# Marcel for Android
Marcel for Android is the Marshell app made for Android, but with additional features. You can download it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tambapps.marcel.android.marshell).

Note that it was designed for dark theme so **this app is much more UI friendly in dark mode**.
An update will come soon(-ish) to better handle light mode.

With this app you can
- Run Marcel shells, as you would using Marshell
- edit Marcel source codes
- Schedule Shell Works, a concept allowing you to run Marcel scripts in the background, with the possibility to schedules the works
and make them periodic.
