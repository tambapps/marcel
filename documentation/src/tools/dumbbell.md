# Dumbbell - Marcel's dependency manager


Dumbbell is a dependency manager for Marcel. It allows you to easily import dependencies (from Maven central) in your scripts,
without having to create a Maven/Gradle project.

It was inspired from [Groovy's grapes](https://groovy-lang.org/grape.html)

Dumbbell doesn't exist yet, but I look forward to develop and release it.
