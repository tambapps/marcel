# Hello World

Let's dive in some code now. Marcel can be used as a scripting language, so you don't need to declare a `main()` function
if you just want to run some code.


```groovy
// HelloWorld.mcl
println("Hello World!")
```

That's it! One line is all it takes to write the famous Hello World program.

To execute it, use [marcl](../tools/marcl.md).

```shell
marcel HelloWorld.mcl
```
