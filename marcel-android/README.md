# Note to self

The java bytecode to Dalvik converter is [d8](https://developer.android.com/tools/d8?hl=fr).

It comes from `{ANDROID_SDK_HOME}/build-tools/{version}/lib/d8.jar`.

Upgrade this each times you bump the sdk of this app. Just download the SDK from Android studio, then the
d8 jar should be at the path specified above for this version.
